# Chat-Page
Try this project by runnning the file "index.js" using a NodeJS terminal (you can do this by going navigating to the folder that "index.js" is in, then run "node index.js"). You can then go to a web-browser and go to "localhost:3000" to see the page.

You can get your friends to join the page by using a proxy tool like ngrok to access it from anywhere. (https://ngrok.com/)

You can edit the code in the ROOT folder but I would not recomend going into the "node-modules" folder.
