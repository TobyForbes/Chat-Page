Try this project by runnning the file "index.js" using a NodeJS terminal and then going to a web-browser and going to "localhost:3000" 
You can then get your friends to join by using a proxy tool like ngrok to access it from anywhere

Edit the code in the ROOT folder but I wouldn't recomend going into the "node-modules" folder
